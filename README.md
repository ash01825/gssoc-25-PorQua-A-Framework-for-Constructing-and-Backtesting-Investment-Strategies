Got it. Hereâ€™s a completely natural, human-written version with the same content but in your toneâ€”direct, natural, and personal while keeping it polished and well-structured.

# Personal Data  
**Name:** Arsh Tulshyan  
**Affiliation:** B.Tech in Computer Engineering, Vidyalankar Institute of Technology  
**Location:** Mumbai, India  

## Studies and Programming Courses Iâ€™ve Taken  
- **Analysis of Algorithms & Advanced Data Structures** â€“ Deep dive into algorithm efficiency, trees, and graph algorithms.  
- **Data Structures & OOP (Java)** â€“ Core data structures and object-oriented programming principles.  
- **Structured Programming (C) & Python** â€“ Fundamentals of programming, problem-solving approaches.  
- **DBMS & Computer Networks** â€“ SQL, database design, network protocols, and security concepts.  
- **Operating Systems & Theory of Computation** â€“ Process management, automata, computational complexity.  
- **Discrete Mathematics & Probability/Statistics** â€“ Graph theory, combinatorics, probability distributions, hypothesis testing.  
- **Linear Algebra & Complex Numbers** â€“ Matrices, eigenvalues, and applications in computing.  
- **Microprocessors & Computer Graphics** â€“ Understanding CPU architectures, rendering techniques.  
- **Digital Logic Circuits & Hardware Fundamentals** â€“ Circuit design, Boolean algebra, and networking basics.  
- **Quantum Physics & Professional Skills** â€“ General understanding of quantum mechanics and career-oriented skills.  

## Some Projects Iâ€™ve Worked On  
- **[Advent of Code 2024](https://github.com/ash01825/AdventofCode-2024)** â€“ Solved high-difficulty algorithmic challenges, refining my C++ and Python problem-solving skills.  
- **AI Crop Disease Prediction** â€“ Built a deep-learning model for detecting crop diseases through image processing, improving accuracy for real-world agricultural applications.  
- **International Quant Championship (IQC)** â€“ Active WorldQuant Brain contributor, participating in IQC to apply quantitative modeling in finance.  

## My Best Skills in Programming & Scientific Computing  
- **Programming:** Strong in **C++, Python, and Java**, focusing on efficiency and optimized implementations.  
- **Algorithms & Data Structures:** Advanced problem-solving with **dynamic programming, graph algorithms, and divide-and-conquer techniques**.  
- **Scientific Computing:** Hands-on experience with **probability theory, linear algebra, and numerical methods** in practical applications.  
- **Machine Learning & AI:** Solid grasp of **supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and their applications in quantitative finance**.  
- **Quantitative Finance:** Experience with **algorithmic trading, statistical modeling, alpha development, and backtesting**.  
- **Software Development:** Built **Flask-based web apps, worked with SQLite/SQL databases, and handled backend development**.  
- **Performance Optimization:** Strong understanding of **low-latency, high-performance coding**, especially in C++.  

## My Programming Style  
I mostly **code in C++** because of how powerful and fast it is. Python is great too, but honestly, it sometimes feels like a cheat code. That said, itâ€™s fun and extremely useful. My approach is to **think through the best solution first, then start coding**â€”efficiency matters to me.  

I enjoy both **working solo and in teams**â€”it really depends on the project. If itâ€™s a team effort, I focus on **clear documentation and making things simple for everyone**. I like things to be well-structured and easy to follow. 

My best skills and what I am most inclined towards are - Competitive Programming and Machine Learning. 

## Availability During the Program  
No conflictsâ€”Iâ€™m fully committed to this project throughout the summer and will be working on it every day.  

## My Plans After GSoC  
I definitely see myself **continuing to contribute to PorQua** even after GSoC ends. My goal is to get into quant, and **GeomScale is the only GSoC org that aligns so well with math and finance**. Since PorQua is mentored by experts in quant, Iâ€™d be grateful for the chance to stay involved.  

## Am I More of a Theorist or a Hacker?  
Iâ€™d say I have a **hacker mindset**â€”I love experimenting and optimizing implementations. But with GeomScale, Iâ€™m drawn to the **deep mathematical and financial statistics side** because it fits perfectly with my goal of working in quant.  

##Hoping to here back soon ðŸ’«
