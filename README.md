# Project
This is just a rough framework of all I'll be doing within this project

# Project Overview  

My project aims to advance **PorQuaâ€™s portfolio optimization, machine learning, and deliverables**, enhancing its theoretical and practical foundations to create a robust framework for real-world investment strategies.  

## Portfolio Optimization Framework  
I will develop **LinearProgram and ConvexProgram** classes as solver wrappers, mirroring QuadraticProgramâ€™s structureâ€”solving:  
\[
\min c^T w \quad \text{and} \quad \min f(w) \quad \text{subject to} \quad A w = b, \quad G w \leq h
\]
via **qpsolvers** (e.g., **CVXPY, Gurobi**) to support linear and convex problems alongside quadratic ones, ensuring solver flexibility and a unified API for seamless problem definition and solution.  

## Portfolio Optimization Objectives  
Iâ€™ll define **extensible objective classes**:  
- **MaximumUtility** will optimize a logarithmic utility function:  
  \[
  U(w) = \ln (w^T r)
  \]
  to reflect investor risk preferences.  
- **MaximumRatio** will target the **Sharpe ratio**:  
  \[
  \frac{w^T r - r_f}{\sqrt{w^T \Sigma w}}
  \]
  and explore **Sortino or Omega ratios**.  
- **MinimumRisk** will minimize metrics like **variance** \( w^T \Sigma w \), **CVaR**:  
  \[
  \alpha^{-1} \int_{-\infty}^{VaR} x dF(x)
  \]
  or **tracking error** \( ||w^T r - b||^2 \).  
- **EqualRiskContribution** will balance **marginal risk contributions**:  
  \[
  w_i \frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial w_i}
  \]
  across assets, all formulated to integrate with the optimization classes.  

## Multi-Objective Optimization  
Iâ€™ll enable **objective combinations**, such as **maximizing utility while minimizing risk**, using weighted objectives:  
\[
\lambda U(w) - (1 - \lambda) w^T \Sigma w
\]
to explore **trade-offs within a convex or quadratic framework**, ensuring theoretical coherence across solvers.  

## Constraints Implementation  
Iâ€™ll enhance constraints with **risk contribution bounds**, enforcing:  
\[
w_i \frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial w_i} \leq \kappa
\]
to prevent risk concentration. This complements **QuadraticProgramâ€™s turnover linearization**:  
\[
|w - w_{\text{init}}| \leq \tau
\]
and introduces a **liquidity constraint**:  
\[
w_i \leq \frac{V_i}{V_{\text{total}}} \cdot 0.05
\]
which will be analyzed for impact on feasible sets and solver performance.  

## Machine Learning - Time Series Prediction (LSTM)  
Iâ€™ll implement **LSTM networks** to forecast **stock returns** \( r_{t+1} \) from historical sequences, designing preprocessing pipelines to normalize inputs (e.g., **log-returns**) and training models across horizons (e.g., **1-day, 5-day**), with theoretical validation against statistical benchmarks.  

## Machine Learning - Learning to Rank (LTR)  
Iâ€™ll develop an **LTR model** (e.g., **RankNet or LambdaRank**) to **order stocks by expected returns**, optimizing a **pairwise ranking loss function**:  
\[
- \sum_{i > j} \ln(1 + e^{-(s_i - s_j)})
\]
ensuring alignment with portfolio objectives through **ranked weight assignments**.  

## Machine Learning - Feature Generation  
Iâ€™ll create a suite of **technical indicators**â€”e.g., **moving averages, RSI, volatility**:  
\[
\sigma_t = \frac{1}{n} \sum (r_t - \bar{r})^2
\]
to enrich ML inputs, grounded in financial theory to **capture market dynamics**.  

## Machine Learning - Feature Selection  
Iâ€™ll apply **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), Lasso**:  
\[
\min ||y - X w||_2^2 + \lambda ||w||_1
\]
and **Random Forest importance scores** to select **the most predictive features**, enhancing model efficiency and interpretability.  

## Deliverables  
I will deliver:  
âœ… **A full-featured optimization engine** spanning **linear, convex, and quadratic** problems.  
âœ… **ML models (LSTM, LTR) for return prediction and ranking**.  
âœ… **A technical feature suite** for model training and portfolio construction.  
âœ… **Detailed documentation with tutorials**, ensuring accessibility for quants and newcomers alike.  

## Theoretical Approach  
1. **Analyze QuadraticProgramâ€™s QP structure** and refine turnover/liquidity constraints.  
2. **Extend to LinearProgram and ConvexProgram**, integrating ML predictions into optimization objectives.  
3. **Develop a backtesting system** to assess **real-world performance**, ensuring solver-agnostic compatibility and mathematical rigor throughout.

## My Programming Style  
I mostly **code in C++** because of how powerful and fast it is. Python is great too, but honestly, it sometimes feels like a cheat code. That said, itâ€™s fun and extremely useful. My approach is to **think through the best solution first, then start coding**â€”efficiency matters to me.  

I enjoy both **working solo and in teams**â€”it really depends on the project. If itâ€™s a team effort, I focus on **clear documentation and making things simple for everyone**. I like things to be well-structured and easy to follow. 

My best skills and what I am most inclined towards are - Competitive Programming and Machine Learning. 

## Availability During the Program  
No conflictsâ€”Iâ€™m fully committed to this project throughout the summer and will be working on it every day.  

## My Plans After GSoC  
I definitely see myself **continuing to contribute to PorQua** even after GSoC ends. My goal is to get into quant, and **GeomScale is the only GSoC org that aligns so well with math and finance**. Since PorQua is mentored by experts in quant, Iâ€™d be grateful for the chance to stay involved.  

## Am I More of a Theorist or a Hacker?  
Iâ€™d say I have a **hacker mindset**â€”I love experimenting and optimizing implementations. But with GeomScale, Iâ€™m drawn to the **deep mathematical and financial statistics side** because it fits perfectly with my goal of working in quant.  

##Hoping to here back soon ðŸ’«
